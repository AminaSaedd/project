<P>
<h3>How we work:</h3>
We have built an excellent reputation for good quality, efficiency and reliability where we had the resource to deliver. In a very short time we have established strong links with scores of leading educational institution and humanitarian organizations working in Somaliland and abroad to fill the void in educational materials supplies.

Our network of partners include: Somaliland Ministry of Education, Oxford press in UK, Text book center in Kenya, educate yourself in Kenya, and Tarbiyat Al-Ghad bookshop in KSA, numerous other organizations bent on philanthropic services to educational institutions and over 15 major primary and secondary schools in Somaliland. 

HEMA has been recognized for excellent service and contribution to community by many local clients including: CARE International, Mercy Corps, ADRA, UNODC, NRC, Young Muslim Academy (The Elm Schools), Nuradin Primary and secondary school,  Iftin School, Nairobi school, Taj Al-iman School, Istanbul KG and Primary School, SOS Primary School, Sunshine school, Haldoor School,  Canadian Primary School and Amaano School. These are our already existing clientele and with our enhanced purchasing power to lower prices of educational materials, weâ€™re looking forward to serve them with more consistency and improved capacity to timely deliver their orders.
